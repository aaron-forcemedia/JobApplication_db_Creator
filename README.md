# Job Application C#/.NET/Entity Framework Demo
## Description
The purpose of this .NET EF-CORE Application is to simulate a job application form to demonstrate EF-Core's abilities in creating a functional database to be used with C#. 
Once applications are entered into the database they can be listed and selected to view details of each record. This database involves a many to many 
relationship with the data inputed. Future versions of this database will see sorting features to help narrow down the best applicant for the job and will also track submission dates in the database.

The application should be fairly self explanatory as far as functionality but to naviagate the menu simply select an option by typing a Character within the '< >' & hit enter. Invalid entries will be discarded.

Menu options are:
| Enter Applicant | Remove Applicant | View Application | Add Skills | Remove Skills | Quit |
